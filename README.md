# Honours Project

This is the code used in my physics honours research project, 2021. It studies the Madala boson dark matter candidate's indirect detection prospects through gamma-rays emitted after annihilation. 

The accompanying pdf for the writeup is [here](), and gives more detail of the methodology and theory.

## Summary of what each file does

[main.py](https://github.com/TessCBear/Honours-Project/blob/main/main.py) is the file used to create the final plots presented in my writeup. It uses objects and methods from the class [astrophysical_class.py](https://github.com/TessCBear/Honours-Project/blob/main/astrophysical_class.py) and data from the .dat files to do this.
